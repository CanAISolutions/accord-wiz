description: TypeScript/React code style and conventions for this repo
---

- **Naming & Types**
  - Exported APIs must have explicit types; avoid `any` in public signatures
  - Use descriptive names; avoid 1â€“2 character identifiers

- **Control Flow**
  - Prefer early returns; handle edge cases first
  - Keep nesting shallow; extract helpers for clarity

- **Formatting**
  - Match existing style; keep lines readable; avoid reformatting unrelated code

- **Testing Hooks**
  - Use `@` alias for imports from `src`
  - In tests, prefer semantic queries; add `data-testid` only when needed

- **Comments**
  - Explain non-obvious decisions; avoid redundant comments
