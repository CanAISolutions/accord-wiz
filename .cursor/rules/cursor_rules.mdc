alwaysApply: true
description: Canonical formatting and authoring rules for all Cursor rules in this repo
---

- **Required Rule Structure**
  - Frontmatter must be present and valid YAML
  - Use one (and only one) of: `alwaysApply`, `globs`, or a `description`-only rule
  - Include succinct, actionable guidance with examples and links

```md
---
alwaysApply: false
# or: globs: *.ts,src/**/*.tsx
# or: description: Retrieval hint for this rule when searching
---
- **What this rule enforces**
  - Specific bullets
  - Examples below
```

- **File References**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` format; paths are relative to repo root
  - Examples: [README.md](mdc:README.md), [vitest.config.ts](mdc:vitest.config.ts), [playwright.config.ts](mdc:playwright.config.ts)

- **Code Examples**
  - Use language-tagged fenced blocks and keep examples minimal and correct
  - Prefer real code from this repo when possible

```typescript
// âœ… DO: Minimal, runnable-style examples
import { validateTerms } from "@/lib/canadaRentalRules";

const result = validateTerms("BC" as any, 2000, 1200, 30);
```

- **Content Guidelines**
  - Start with an overview, then concrete, testable rules
  - Cross-reference existing rules to keep things DRY
  - Prefer repository code references over generic theory

- **Maintenance**
  - Update rules when patterns change; remove outdated guidance
  - Reference real files (e.g., tests, configs) to keep rules enforceable
